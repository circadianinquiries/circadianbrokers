        <p>A lot of people think they’re fully covered until something goes wrong. That’s usually when the surprises show up. The truth is, not every policy is built to protect what actually matters to you.</p>
        <p>As of January 1, 2025, California’s new minimum auto insurance requirements are $30,000 for bodily injury liability per person, $60,000 for bodily injury liability per accident, and $15,000 for property damage liability per accident. With these updated limits now in effect, it’s more important than ever to make sure your policy actually protects you.</p>
        <p>This is where having someone local really helps. We take the time to understand how you drive, what you need, and what makes the most sense for your situation. It’s not about selling you more but about making sure you’re not left exposed when you least expect it.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for auto insurance in Brentwood, CA, we’ll help you cut through the confusion and find coverage that fits both your lifestyle and your budget. No gimmicks, just insurance that actually works when you need it most.</p>
